## 1.What is your experience using webpack

Webpack is a powerful module bundler that allows us to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single file, which is necessary for browsers to efficiently load applications. Without Webpack, you would need to include a **script** tag for every JavaScript file, which becomes impractical in larger applications with hundreds of files. Webpack simplifies this by parsing all files, analyzing dependencies based on import and export statements, and bundling them together into one or more optimized bundles.

In addition to bundling, Webpack enables various optimizations, such as code splitting, tree shaking, and minification, which improve performance. I have some experience working with Webpack, including setting up projects from scratch and configuring loaders and plugins to handle tasks like compiling TypeScript, processing CSS or LESS, and optimizing production builds. I'm also familiar with using plugins like HtmlWebpackPlugin for automating HTML generation and TerserPlugin for minifying JavaScript.

## 2.Since you’ve worked a lot with Webpack and configured projects from scratch, can you walk me through how you would set up a basic Webpack configuration for a React application? Specifically, how would you handle Babel for JSX transpilation and CSS file processing?

To set up a basic webpack configuration, I would start by initializing the project using ==npm init== to create ==package.json==. Then I'd install the necessary dependencies, including webpack, webpack-cli, react, Babel and loaders for transpilation and CSS processing.For example, I’d install Babel with presets like @babel/preset-env and @babel/preset-react for handling modern JavaScript and JSX.

Next, I’d create a webpack.config.js file. The entry point would be the main JavaScript file, like src/index.js, and the output would specify the bundled file, typically in a dist directory. For handling React, I’d set up Babel with a babel-loader rule to transpile JavaScript and JSX files, excluding node_modules. For styles, I’d configure CSS processing with style-loader and css-loader.

Then add scripts into package.json, like start: webpack serve. build: webpack

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: "babel-loader",
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".js", ".jsx"],
  },
  devServer: {
    static: "./dist", // Serve files from the dist directory
    hot: true, // Enable hot module replacement
  },
  mode: "development",
};
```

## 3.Are you familiar with tree shaking

Yes, It’s basically what happens at build time to optimize the bundle. Webpack analyzes the code to find any modules or parts of modules that were imported but aren’t actually being used in the application. Then it removes them to keep the bundle as small as possible.

This process helps improve web performance because a smaller bundle means faster load times and less memory usage for the browser. It’s a great way to ensure the application is efficient and performs well for users.

## 4. Have you use tree shaking professionally in production at any stage, can you give me an example

Yes, I have used tree shaking professionally in production, especially when optimizing bundle sizes. As of Webpack 5, tree shaking is enabled by default when the mode is set to production. This means that Webpack automatically analyzes the dependency graph and removes unused code from the final bundle.

One key aspect of tree shaking is that it works effectively with ES6 static imports (import/export), as these allow Webpack to determine the exact usage of modules at build time. For example, if you have a utility library but only use a few functions, Wen  
However, there are limitations. Tree shaking doesn't work for CommonJS and dynamic imports, because they are determined at running time. So if the libraries or dependencies are not tree-shaking-friendly (e.g., they don’t use ES6 modules), unused parts of the code will still be bundled.

In my case, I encountered a scenario where a third-party library was increasing the bundle size significantly. Upon inspection, I realized it wasn’t tree-shaking-friendly because it used CommonJS. To resolve this, I find alternative libary that supported ES6 modules. This reduced the bundle size and improved load times for the application.

## 5. Are you familiar with code splitting? How does it work, and what is it used for in Webpack

Yes. Code splitting is a really useful technique in Webpack. It’s all about breaking your code into smaller pieces—or chunks— so that you don’t end up serving one huge bundle to the browser. Instead, Webpack helps load only the pieces of code that are needed at a given time.

Webpack starts by analyzing your dependency graph, which maps out all the relationships between the modules in your application. Based on that, it identifies opportunities to split the code. For example, if you write code that’s only used on a specific route or feature, Webpack can put that into its own chunk and load it only when it’s needed.

You can implement code splitting in a few ways:

1. Dynamic Imports: You can use JavaScript’s import() syntax to load code on demand. This is great for lazy loading components or routes.
2. Entry Points: If you define multiple entry points in your Webpack config, Webpack will generate separate bundles for each.
3. Optimization Plugins: Webpack has built-in features like the SplitChunksPlugin that automatically split shared or vendor code into separate chunks to avoid duplication.

The main benefit of code splitting is performance. Instead of making users download everything upfront, you’re giving them just what they need, when they need it. It makes the initial load time faster and helps improve the overall user experience, especially for larger apps.

## 6. What's the dependency graph and what's used for in webpack?

The dependency graph in Webpack is a data structure that represents the relationships between the modules. Webpack starts building the graph from the entry point, which is typically the main file of the application. It analyzes the code by following all the ==import== or ==require== statements recursively, mapping out how each module depends on others. This process continues until Webpack reaches the leaves of the graph, meaning modules that don’t import anything else. The result is essentially a tree-like structure that Webpack uses to organize and track all modules. This graph is crucial because it helps Webpack perform several key tasks:

1. Bundling: Webpack uses the dependency graph to combine all modules into a single or multiple bundles.
2. Tree Shaking: It identifies and eliminates unused modules or exports to optimize the bundle size for production.
3. Code Splitting: It can analyze the graph to determine points where the code can be split into smaller chunks for lazy loading or dynamic imports.

In short, the dependency graph is the core abstraction in Webpack that enables it to transform individual files into efficient bundles optimized for production

## 7. Are you familiar with HMR? How does it work?

Yes, absolutely! Hot Module Replacement, is a really useful feature in Webpack that lets you update parts of your app while it’s running, without refreshing the whole page.

Here’s how it works:

First, Webpack watches your files for changes. When you edit a file, it picks up the change and recompiles just that module instead of rebuilding everything. Then, it sends the updated module to the browser, usually over a WebSocket connection using webpack-dev-server.

Once the browser gets the update, the Webpack runtime replaces the old module with the new one on the fly. If the module supports HMR—for example, in a React app using React Fast Refresh—the update happens smoothly, and the app state is preserved.

If a module doesn’t support HMR, Webpack might fall back to reloading the page, but it tries to avoid that whenever possible.

This makes development so much faster because you can instantly see your changes without losing your app’s state or waiting for a full reload. It’s especially great for tweaking UI or debugging.
