## 1.What is your experience using webpack

Webpack is a powerful module bundler that allows us to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single file, which is necessary for browsers to efficiently load applications. Without Webpack, you would need to include a **script** tag for every JavaScript file, which becomes impractical in larger applications with hundreds of files. Webpack simplifies this by parsing all files, analyzing dependencies based on import and export statements, and bundling them together into one or more optimized bundles.

In addition to bundling, Webpack enables various optimizations, such as code splitting, tree shaking, and minification, which improve performance. I have some experience working with Webpack, including setting up projects from scratch and configuring loaders and plugins to handle tasks like compiling TypeScript, processing CSS or LESS, and optimizing production builds. I'm also familiar with using plugins like HtmlWebpackPlugin for automating HTML generation and TerserPlugin for minifying JavaScript.

## 2.Since you’ve worked a lot with Webpack and configured projects from scratch, can you walk me through how you would set up a basic Webpack configuration for a React application? Specifically, how would you handle Babel for JSX transpilation and CSS file processing?

To set up a basic webpack configuration, I would start by initializing the project using ==npm init== to create ==package.json==. Then I'd install the necessary dependencies, including webpack, webpack-cli, react, Babel and loaders for transpilation and CSS processing.For example, I’d install Babel with presets like @babel/preset-env and @babel/preset-react for handling modern JavaScript and JSX.

Next, I’d create a webpack.config.js file. The entry point would be the main JavaScript file, like src/index.js, and the output would specify the bundled file, typically in a dist directory. For handling React, I’d set up Babel with a babel-loader rule to transpile JavaScript and JSX files, excluding node_modules. For styles, I’d configure CSS processing with style-loader and css-loader.

Then add scripts into package.json, like start: webpack serve. build: webpack

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: "babel-loader",
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".js", ".jsx"],
  },
  devServer: {
    static: "./dist", // Serve files from the dist directory
    hot: true, // Enable hot module replacement
  },
  mode: "development",
};
```

## 3.Are you familiar with tree shaking

Yes, It’s basically what happens at build time to optimize the bundle. Webpack analyzes the code to find any modules or parts of modules that were imported but aren’t actually being used in the application. Then it removes them to keep the bundle as small as possible.

This process helps improve web performance because a smaller bundle means faster load times and less memory usage for the browser. It’s a great way to ensure the application is efficient and performs well for users.

## 4. Have you use tree shaking professionally in production at any stage, can you give me an example

Yes, I have used tree shaking professionally in production, especially when optimizing bundle sizes. As of Webpack 5, tree shaking is enabled by default when the mode is set to production. This means that Webpack automatically analyzes the dependency graph and removes unused code from the final bundle.

One key aspect of tree shaking is that it works effectively with ES6 static imports (import/export), as these allow Webpack to determine the exact usage of modules at build time. For example, if you have a utility library but only use a few functions, Webpack will exclude the unused functions from the final bundle.

However, there are limitations. Tree shaking doesn't work for CommonJS and dynamic imports, because they are determined at running time. So if the libraries or dependencies are not tree-shaking-friendly (e.g., they don’t use ES6 modules), unused parts of the code will still be bundled.

In my case, I encountered a scenario where a third-party library was increasing the bundle size significantly. Upon inspection, I realized it wasn’t tree-shaking-friendly because it used CommonJS. To resolve this, I find alternative libary that supported ES6 modules. This reduced the bundle size and improved load times for the application.

## 5. Are you familiar with code splitting? How does it work, and what is it used for in Webpack

The dependency graph in Webpack is basically a map of all the relationships between the modules in your application. Webpack starts with the entry point—usually your main file—and works its way through the code, following all the import or require statements.

It does this recursively, figuring out which modules depend on which, until it reaches the "leaves" of the graph—those modules that don’t depend on anything else. What you end up with is a kind of tree structure that shows how everything in your app is connected.

This graph is super important because it’s what Webpack uses to do its magic. For example:

Bundling: It uses the graph to figure out how to combine all your modules into one or more bundles.
Tree Shaking: It looks at the graph to identify unused code and removes it to make the final bundle smaller.
Code Splitting: The graph helps Webpack figure out where it can break your code into smaller chunks for things like lazy loading or dynamic imports.
So, in short, the dependency graph is the core thing that lets Webpack take your individual files and turn them into optimized bundles ready for production.

## 6. What's the dependency graph and what's used for in webpack?

The dependency graph in Webpack is a data structure that represents the relationships between the modules in an application. Webpack starts building the graph from the entry point, which is typically the main file of the application.

It analyzes the code by following all the ==import== or ==require== statements recursively, mapping out how each module depends on others. This process continues until Webpack reaches the leaves of the graph, meaning modules that don’t import anything further.

The result is essentially a tree-like structure that Webpack uses to organize and track all modules. This graph is crucial because it helps Webpack perform several key tasks:

1. Bundling: Webpack uses the dependency graph to combine all modules into a single or multiple bundles.
2. Tree Shaking: It identifies and eliminates unused modules or exports to optimize the bundle size for production.
   Code Splitting: It can analyze the graph to determine points where the code can be split into smaller chunks for lazy loading or dynamic imports.
3. In short, the dependency graph is the core abstraction in Webpack that enables it to transform individual files into efficient bundles optimized for production

## 7. Are you familiar with HMR? How does it work?

Yes, absolutely! Hot Module Replacement, or HMR, is a really useful feature in Webpack that lets you update modules in a running application without needing to refresh the entire page.

Here’s how it typically works:

First, Webpack monitors your files for changes. When you update a file, it detects that change and recompiles just the modified module, rather than rebuilding everything. Next, it sends the updated module to the browser, usually via a WebSocket connection provided by webpack-dev-server.

Once the browser receives the update, the Webpack runtime swaps out the old module with the new one—right there, while the app is still running. If the module is set up to support HMR, like with React using tools like React Fast Refresh, the update happens seamlessly without losing the app’s state.

If the module doesn’t support HMR, Webpack may fall back to a full reload, but the goal is to avoid that whenever possible.

This whole process makes development much faster and smoother since you can see changes immediately without losing your place or waiting for a full reload. It’s especially great for fine-tuning UIs or debugging.
