## What's the CSS in JS and tell me the advantage and disadvantage

CSS-in-JS is a way to write CSS directly in JavaScript. It came about because, as we write more interactive JavaScript, we often need styles to change dynamically based on states or variables—like when you click a button and the style updates instantly.

Now, traditionally, you could handle this by toggling CSS classes on an element, but CSS-in-JS makes this process more easier. It allows you to define and manage your styles directly in JavaScript, using variables or logic to dynamically update styles. This wasn’t really possible before because CSS was static.

With CSS-in-JS, you write styles inside JavaScript file, and tools like Webpack handle the rest. They extract those styles, generate the necessary classes, and attach them to the DOM at runtime—all behind the scenes. It’s super convenient, especially in modern apps, because you don’t have to switch between CSS files and JavaScript—you manage everything in one place. Another advantage is scoped styles, reducing the chances of style conflicts.

Disadvantages:

1. Performance concerns:

- No Browser Caching:
  Since styles are generated dynamically at running time, so it cannot be cached like tradition way.

- Layout Shifts:
  Styles are applied only after the JavaScript runs, unlike traditional CSS that’s applied early in the loading process. This means the page starts rendering without proper styles in place, and once the styles are applied, elements might resize or move around.

- Runtime Overhead:
  Generating styles dynamically adds extra work for the browser, and in larger applications, this can impact performance and responsiveness.

2. Learning curve: It’s a shift from traditional CSS, so it takes some time to learn and adapt.
3. Tooling dependency: It relies heavily on tools like Webpack or Babel, which adds complexity to the build process.
4. Debugging Challenges:
   Since styles are dynamically created and injected into the DOM, inspecting and debugging them can be more difficult compared to traditional static CSS files. This can complicate identifying issues during development.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import styled from "styled-components";

// Create a styled button
const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: ${(props) => (props.isActive ? "green" : "gray")};
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 16px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: ${(props) => (props.isActive ? "darkgreen" : "darkgray")};
  }
`;

const App = () => {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  const toggleActive = () => {
    setIsActive(!isActive);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <StyledButton isActive={isActive} onClick={toggleActive}>
        {isActive ? "Active" : "Inactive"}
      </StyledButton>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
