# Type

## Primary Types

- boolean
- string
- number
- null (It belongs to primary type, altough typeof null outputs 'object')
- undefined
- symbol
- bigInt
- object

## Subtype of Object

functions and arrays(note: low-case)

## Build-in Objects(other subtype of object)

- Boolean
- String
- Number
- Object
- RegExp
- Error
- Date

In js, they are actually build-in functions. They can be used as a constructor, with the result being a newly constructed object of the subtype.

```javascript
var strPrimitive = "I am a string";
typeof strPrimitive; // "string"
strPrimitive instanceof String; // false

var strObject = new String("I am a string");
typeof strObject; // "object"
strObject instanceof String; // true

// inspect the object sub-type
Object.prototype.toString.call(strObject); // [object String]
```

"I am a string" is a primitive literal and immutable value, that means you cannot directly modify its content, javascript automatically wrap the value in a temporay <mark>String</mark> object when performing operations on it, which it returns a new value not modify itself.

## How to check data type of a variable

- Basic types: Use typeof.
- Using instanceof
- Distinguishing objects (like array or date): Use Object.prototype.toString or specific checks like Array.isArray.
- Using isNaN or Number.isNaN

# Contents

Contents which implies that these values are actually stored inside the object, that's merely an appearance. The engine stores value in implementation-dependent ways, and may very well not store in some object container. What is stored in the container are these properties name, which act as reference to
