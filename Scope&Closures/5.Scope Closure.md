# Scope Closure

## How Scope Works
Hoisting during lexing phase before interpreted. Meanwhile the engine remember variables and functions declarations in perspective scope. At execution, the engine looks up the variables and functions by their identifier names and assigns values.

## What's closure

Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.

Any of the various ways that functions can be passed around as values, and indeed invoked in other locations, are all examples of observing/exercising closure.

Examples

``` javascript
function foo() {
    var a = 2;

    function bar() {
        console.log( a );
    }

    return bar;
}

var baz = foo();

baz();
```
``` javascript
function foo() {
    var a = 2;

    function baz() {
        console.log( a ); // 2
    }

    bar( baz );
}

function bar(fn) {
    fn(); // look ma, I saw closure!
}
```
