# Hoisting

Hoisting is a process that occurs during the lexing phase, where varible and function declarations are conceptually **moved** from where they appear in the flow of the code to the top of the code. That means only the declarations themselves are hoisted, while any assignments or other executable logic are left _in place_.

The engine will compile your javascript code before it interprets it. Part of the compilation phase was to find and associate all declarations scope. This is the heart of lexical scope.

## Function First

That means functions are hoisted first, and then variables.

Consider:

```javascript
foo(); // 1
var foo;
function foo() {
  console.log(1);
}
foo = function () {
  console.log(2);
};
```

This sippet is interpreted by the Engine as

```javascript
function foo() {
  1;
}
foo();
foo = function () {
  2;
};
```
Fuction declarations that appear inside of normal blocks typically hosit to the enclosing scope, rather than being conditional as this code implies:
``` javascript
foo(); // "b"

var a = true;
if (a) {
   function foo() { console.log("a"); }
}
else {
   function foo() { console.log("b"); }
}
```
``` javascript
   function foo() { console.log("b"); }
var a;
a = true;
if(a) 
```
