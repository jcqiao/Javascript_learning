# Scope

**Scope** in programing refers to the context within variables are defined, accessed and manipulated. It determines the visibility and lifetime of variables, specifying where they can be used in the code. There are typically several types of scope:

1. Global scope
2. Local scope
3. Block scope

In a short, scope is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name. Maybe there are many nested scope, if a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, Engine consults the outer containing scope, continuing until is found or until the outermost scope has been reached.
